1
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:16,125
In the year 6 CE,

2
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:18,419
a fire devastated Rome.

3
00:00:18,419 --> 00:00:19,837
In response,

4
00:00:19,837 --> 00:00:24,216
Emperor Augustus did something
that had never been done before

5
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:26,093
in the history of the Empire.

6
00:00:26,635 --> 00:00:30,723
He created a permanent
team of firefighters

7
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:33,559
who used buckets just like this one.

8
00:00:34,643 --> 00:00:40,733
Augustus understood that individuals alone
can't protect themselves from fires.

9
00:00:41,316 --> 00:00:43,485
They need help from the community.

10
00:00:43,527 --> 00:00:46,155
When one person's house is on fire,

11
00:00:46,196 --> 00:00:49,700
that creates a risk
for everyone else's homes.

12
00:00:50,451 --> 00:00:56,457
And so what we've had these last few years
is like a horrific global fire.

13
00:00:56,832 --> 00:01:02,337
The COVID pandemic has killed millions
and upended economies,

14
00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:06,467
and we want to stop that
from happening again.

15
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:10,971
COVID, it's hard to overstate
how awful it's been.

16
00:01:11,555 --> 00:01:16,560
It's increased the health inequities
between the rich and the poor.

17
00:01:16,602 --> 00:01:21,190
Survival depended partly
on your income, your race,

18
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,983
the neighborhood you lived in.

19
00:01:23,442 --> 00:01:26,236
And so we should seize this opportunity

20
00:01:26,278 --> 00:01:29,114
to create a world
where everyone has a chance

21
00:01:29,114 --> 00:01:31,283
to live a healthy and productive life.

22
00:01:31,742 --> 00:01:38,540
Also a life free from the fear
of the next COVID-19.

23
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:42,002
When I was on this stage in 2015,

24
00:01:42,044 --> 00:01:44,963
I was one of many people who said

25
00:01:44,963 --> 00:01:47,841
we weren't ready
and we needed to get ready.

26
00:01:48,634 --> 00:01:49,885
We didn't.

27
00:01:50,803 --> 00:01:54,014
The speech actually was watched
by a lot of people.

28
00:01:54,389 --> 00:01:59,228
But 90 percent of the views
were after it was too late.

29
00:01:59,269 --> 00:02:01,730
(Laughter)

30
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:05,859
So now I hope the need is clear.

31
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,487
And of course, we've learned a lot.

32
00:02:08,487 --> 00:02:10,405
During this pandemic,

33
00:02:10,447 --> 00:02:14,952
a lot of things worked well,
a lot of things didn't work well.

34
00:02:14,993 --> 00:02:19,414
And so we have all that knowledge
to build a prevention system.

35
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:26,421
COVID-19 can be the last pandemic
if we take the right steps.

36
00:02:27,297 --> 00:02:30,134
So how, what are these steps?

37
00:02:30,843 --> 00:02:34,054
Well, let's go back
and look at what the Romans did.

38
00:02:34,513 --> 00:02:40,894
Think about how, over time,
we've gotten good at preventing big fires.

39
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,772
Fire prevention is kind of
this pervasive thing.

40
00:02:43,814 --> 00:02:45,149
It's well funded.

41
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,733
It's well understood.

42
00:02:46,775 --> 00:02:48,902
If an alarm went off right now,

43
00:02:48,944 --> 00:02:52,447
everyone here would know
we're supposed to calmly gather,

44
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:55,033
go out and wait instructions.

45
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:56,994
We'd know that help would be on the way

46
00:02:57,035 --> 00:03:01,248
because we have lots of trained
firefighters who practice.

47
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:07,421
The United States alone has 370,000
full-time firefighters,

48
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:11,383
even more than I guessed
that number would be.

49
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:13,260
We also have access to water.

50
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:18,849
The United States, for example,
has almost nine million fire hydrants.

51
00:03:18,891 --> 00:03:22,019
And so that type of investment,
that type of practice,

52
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:28,150
that type of system
is what we need to stop pandemics.

53
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:32,029
Now, often in movies,
we'll have pandemics.

54
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,281
And I'm always impressed
with what takes place.

55
00:03:34,323 --> 00:03:38,243
Let's look at an example
of this rapid response.

56
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:39,745
[Motaba River Valley, Zaire]

57
00:03:40,037 --> 00:03:41,747
(Helicopter rotors whirring)

58
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:56,261
Well, that's quite impressive.

59
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:57,471
We don't need the music,

60
00:03:57,471 --> 00:04:01,266
but otherwise we saw
exactly what should happen.

61
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:02,893
An outbreak’s detected.

62
00:04:03,227 --> 00:04:06,271
Very quickly, literally within days,

63
00:04:06,271 --> 00:04:08,232
doctors are dispatched.

64
00:04:08,232 --> 00:04:11,985
They have a helicopter
to get into exactly ground zero.

65
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,947
They go in there,
and they’ve got the right tools.

66
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,369
And this is what should happen
when an outbreak is spotted.

67
00:04:21,203 --> 00:04:25,249
But we don't have that team,
we don't have those resources.

68
00:04:25,624 --> 00:04:29,419
And if an outbreak took place
in a low-income country,

69
00:04:29,461 --> 00:04:31,088
it could be literally months

70
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:34,383
before we started to orchestrate
those resources.

71
00:04:34,424 --> 00:04:36,843
So despite what you see in movies,

72
00:04:36,885 --> 00:04:41,848
there is no group of experts
standing by to prevent this disaster.

73
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:44,851
So we have to create a new team.

74
00:04:44,893 --> 00:04:47,771
I believe we should create
what I call the GERM team.

75
00:04:48,146 --> 00:04:53,777
Germ stands for Global Epidemic
Response and Mobilization.

76
00:04:54,278 --> 00:04:56,488
This group is full-time.

77
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:59,866
Their only priority
is pandemic prevention.

78
00:05:00,409 --> 00:05:02,911
It's made up of a diverse
set of specialists

79
00:05:02,911 --> 00:05:06,123
with a lot of different
realms of expertise:

80
00:05:06,164 --> 00:05:09,626
epidemiologists, data scientists,

81
00:05:09,668 --> 00:05:11,336
logistics experts.

82
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:13,839
And it's not just scientific
and medical knowledge.

83
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:17,926
They also have to have communication
and diplomacy skills.

84
00:05:18,468 --> 00:05:20,262
The cost of this team is significant.

85
00:05:20,304 --> 00:05:21,972
It's over a billion a year

86
00:05:22,014 --> 00:05:26,184
to support the 3,000 people
who would be on this team.

87
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:32,566
And its mission is to stop outbreaks
before they become pandemics.

88
00:05:32,607 --> 00:05:35,777
The work would be coordinated by the WHO.

89
00:05:36,194 --> 00:05:39,323
They'd be present in many
locations around the world,

90
00:05:39,364 --> 00:05:42,367
stationed in public health agencies.

91
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:45,287
They'd work closely
with the national teams,

92
00:05:45,287 --> 00:05:47,289
depending on the income level.

93
00:05:47,789 --> 00:05:50,417
They'd have more
in the lower-income countries.

94
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:53,462
You know, for example,
we could have GERM members

95
00:05:53,754 --> 00:06:00,302
say an epidemiologist, working
out of the Africa CDC office in Abuja.

96
00:06:00,344 --> 00:06:05,140
And a very important thing
is that like firefighters,

97
00:06:05,182 --> 00:06:08,810
a GERM team would do drills.

98
00:06:08,852 --> 00:06:10,729
When you want to have quick response,

99
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:13,648
when you want to make sure
you have all the pieces there

100
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,402
and you can move very quickly,
practice is key.

101
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:20,614
That's how you make sure
everyone knows what to do.

102
00:06:21,239 --> 00:06:25,077
Now, this team, there could be periods
where there's no risky outbreak

103
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:28,038
and they can keep their skills strong

104
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:31,541
by working on some
of the other infectious diseases,

105
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:34,044
but that would be a second priority.

106
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:38,006
They would work with countries
to strengthen their health systems.

107
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:43,845
The health systems are the front line.

108
00:06:44,346 --> 00:06:46,890
You need to know if, say,

109
00:06:46,932 --> 00:06:50,560
a lot of people show up
with a new kind of cough,

110
00:06:51,269 --> 00:06:55,565
that’s when GERM needs to look into it
and say, is this an outbreak?

111
00:06:55,607 --> 00:06:57,109
Is there a new pathogen here?

112
00:06:57,109 --> 00:06:59,111
What is the sequence of that?

113
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:03,615
And so for all of this,
the first 100 days are key.

114
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:06,410
Viruses spread exponentially.

115
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:11,957
And so if you get in there
when the infection rate is fairly small,

116
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:14,459
you can actually stop the spread.

117
00:07:14,876 --> 00:07:17,170
You know, in this epidemic,

118
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,424
if we'd been able to stop it
within 100 days,

119
00:07:20,465 --> 00:07:24,094
we would have saved
over 98 percent of the lives.

120
00:07:24,594 --> 00:07:26,972
Now, we did have countries
that did a good job.

121
00:07:26,972 --> 00:07:28,682
Australia is an example.

122
00:07:28,723 --> 00:07:31,893
They orchestrated diagnostic capacity.

123
00:07:31,935 --> 00:07:36,273
They came up with distancing policies
and quarantine policies.

124
00:07:36,314 --> 00:07:40,735
And so their overall death rate
per capita will be well less

125
00:07:40,777 --> 00:07:42,863
than a 10th of other countries.

126
00:07:43,155 --> 00:07:46,908
But we did not, as a world, contain it.

127
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,703
And that's what we have to do next time.

128
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,998
When COVID struck,
we were almost like Rome

129
00:07:52,998 --> 00:07:56,501
before they had
fire buckets and firefighters.

130
00:07:57,085 --> 00:08:00,589
We didn't have the people,
the systems or the tools we need.

131
00:08:00,589 --> 00:08:02,132
Now, with the right investments,

132
00:08:02,174 --> 00:08:05,760
we can have a whole new
generation of tools,

133
00:08:05,802 --> 00:08:09,181
better diagnostics,
therapeutics and vaccines.

134
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:13,894
A good example in the diagnostic area
is this little machine,

135
00:08:13,935 --> 00:08:15,395
this is called the Lumira.

136
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:20,275
We can have these all over the world
that can test for any number of diseases.

137
00:08:20,317 --> 00:08:22,569
It’s a 10th as expensive as PCR,

138
00:08:22,611 --> 00:08:24,779
it’s absolutely as accurate,
and it’s simple.

139
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:26,865
So it can be used anywhere.

140
00:08:26,865 --> 00:08:28,783
We need other R&D investments.

141
00:08:28,825 --> 00:08:31,828
One that I'm very excited
about is the idea of a drug

142
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:35,832
that you inhale that blocks you
from getting infected.

143
00:08:35,874 --> 00:08:39,377
It can be pathogen-independent
and trigger your immune system

144
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,254
so that you'll be protected.

145
00:08:41,796 --> 00:08:44,341
A lot of the tools, the diagnostic tools

146
00:08:44,382 --> 00:08:47,928
and those infection-blocking
tools are important

147
00:08:47,969 --> 00:08:50,472
because they can be staged in advance.

148
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:52,641
Now, we also need vaccines,

149
00:08:52,682 --> 00:08:56,019
but we want to stop the outbreak

150
00:08:56,061 --> 00:08:59,397
before we have to do
a global vaccination campaign.
