1
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:16,125
In the year 6 CE,

2
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:18,419
a fire devastated Rome.

3
00:00:18,419 --> 00:00:19,837
In response,

4
00:00:19,837 --> 00:00:24,216
Emperor Augustus did something
that had never been done before

5
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:26,093
in the history of the Empire.

6
00:00:26,635 --> 00:00:30,723
He created a permanent
team of firefighters

7
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:33,559
who used buckets just like this one.

8
00:00:34,643 --> 00:00:40,733
Augustus understood that individuals alone
can't protect themselves from fires.

9
00:00:41,316 --> 00:00:43,485
They need help from the community.

10
00:00:43,527 --> 00:00:46,155
When one person's house is on fire,

11
00:00:46,196 --> 00:00:49,700
that creates a risk
for everyone else's homes.

12
00:00:50,451 --> 00:00:56,457
And so what we've had these last few years
is like a horrific global fire.

13
00:00:56,832 --> 00:01:02,337
The COVID pandemic has killed millions
and upended economies,

14
00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:06,467
and we want to stop that
from happening again.

15
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:10,971
COVID, it's hard to overstate
how awful it's been.

16
00:01:11,555 --> 00:01:16,560
It's increased the health inequities
between the rich and the poor.

17
00:01:16,602 --> 00:01:21,190
Survival depended partly
on your income, your race,

18
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,983
the neighborhood you lived in.

19
00:01:23,442 --> 00:01:26,236
And so we should seize this opportunity

20
00:01:26,278 --> 00:01:29,114
to create a world
where everyone has a chance
