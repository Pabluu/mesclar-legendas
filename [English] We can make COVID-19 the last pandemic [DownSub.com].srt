1
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:16,125
In the year 6 CE,

2
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:18,419
a fire devastated Rome.

3
00:00:18,419 --> 00:00:19,837
In response,

4
00:00:19,837 --> 00:00:24,216
Emperor Augustus did something
that had never been done before

5
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:26,093
in the history of the Empire.

6
00:00:26,635 --> 00:00:30,723
He created a permanent
team of firefighters

7
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:33,559
who used buckets just like this one.

8
00:00:34,643 --> 00:00:40,733
Augustus understood that individuals alone
can't protect themselves from fires.

9
00:00:41,316 --> 00:00:43,485
They need help from the community.

10
00:00:43,527 --> 00:00:46,155
When one person's house is on fire,

11
00:00:46,196 --> 00:00:49,700
that creates a risk
for everyone else's homes.

12
00:00:50,451 --> 00:00:56,457
And so what we've had these last few years
is like a horrific global fire.

13
00:00:56,832 --> 00:01:02,337
The COVID pandemic has killed millions
and upended economies,

14
00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:06,467
and we want to stop that
from happening again.

15
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:10,971
COVID, it's hard to overstate
how awful it's been.

16
00:01:11,555 --> 00:01:16,560
It's increased the health inequities
between the rich and the poor.

17
00:01:16,602 --> 00:01:21,190
Survival depended partly
on your income, your race,

18
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,983
the neighborhood you lived in.

19
00:01:23,442 --> 00:01:26,236
And so we should seize this opportunity

20
00:01:26,278 --> 00:01:29,114
to create a world
where everyone has a chance

21
00:01:29,114 --> 00:01:31,283
to live a healthy and productive life.

22
00:01:31,742 --> 00:01:38,540
Also a life free from the fear
of the next COVID-19.

23
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:42,002
When I was on this stage in 2015,

24
00:01:42,044 --> 00:01:44,963
I was one of many people who said

25
00:01:44,963 --> 00:01:47,841
we weren't ready
and we needed to get ready.

26
00:01:48,634 --> 00:01:49,885
We didn't.

27
00:01:50,803 --> 00:01:54,014
The speech actually was watched
by a lot of people.

28
00:01:54,389 --> 00:01:59,228
But 90 percent of the views
were after it was too late.

29
00:01:59,269 --> 00:02:01,730
(Laughter)

30
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:05,859
So now I hope the need is clear.

31
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,487
And of course, we've learned a lot.

32
00:02:08,487 --> 00:02:10,405
During this pandemic,

33
00:02:10,447 --> 00:02:14,952
a lot of things worked well,
a lot of things didn't work well.

34
00:02:14,993 --> 00:02:19,414
And so we have all that knowledge
to build a prevention system.

35
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:26,421
COVID-19 can be the last pandemic
if we take the right steps.

36
00:02:27,297 --> 00:02:30,134
So how, what are these steps?

37
00:02:30,843 --> 00:02:34,054
Well, let's go back
and look at what the Romans did.

38
00:02:34,513 --> 00:02:40,894
Think about how, over time,
we've gotten good at preventing big fires.

39
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,772
Fire prevention is kind of
this pervasive thing.

40
00:02:43,814 --> 00:02:45,149
It's well funded.

41
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,733
It's well understood.

42
00:02:46,775 --> 00:02:48,902
If an alarm went off right now,

43
00:02:48,944 --> 00:02:52,447
everyone here would know
we're supposed to calmly gather,

44
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:55,033
go out and wait instructions.

45
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:56,994
We'd know that help would be on the way

46
00:02:57,035 --> 00:03:01,248
because we have lots of trained
firefighters who practice.

47
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:07,421
The United States alone has 370,000
full-time firefighters,

48
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:11,383
even more than I guessed
that number would be.

49
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:13,260
We also have access to water.

50
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:18,849
The United States, for example,
has almost nine million fire hydrants.

51
00:03:18,891 --> 00:03:22,019
And so that type of investment,
that type of practice,

52
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:28,150
that type of system
is what we need to stop pandemics.

53
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:32,029
Now, often in movies,
we'll have pandemics.

54
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,281
And I'm always impressed
with what takes place.

55
00:03:34,323 --> 00:03:38,243
Let's look at an example
of this rapid response.

56
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:39,745
[Motaba River Valley, Zaire]

57
00:03:40,037 --> 00:03:41,747
(Helicopter rotors whirring)

58
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:56,261
Well, that's quite impressive.

59
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:57,471
We don't need the music,

60
00:03:57,471 --> 00:04:01,266
but otherwise we saw
exactly what should happen.

61
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:02,893
An outbreak’s detected.

62
00:04:03,227 --> 00:04:06,271
Very quickly, literally within days,

63
00:04:06,271 --> 00:04:08,232
doctors are dispatched.

64
00:04:08,232 --> 00:04:11,985
They have a helicopter
to get into exactly ground zero.

65
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,947
They go in there,
and they’ve got the right tools.

66
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,369
And this is what should happen
when an outbreak is spotted.

67
00:04:21,203 --> 00:04:25,249
But we don't have that team,
we don't have those resources.

68
00:04:25,624 --> 00:04:29,419
And if an outbreak took place
in a low-income country,

69
00:04:29,461 --> 00:04:31,088
it could be literally months

70
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:34,383
before we started to orchestrate
those resources.

71
00:04:34,424 --> 00:04:36,843
So despite what you see in movies,

72
00:04:36,885 --> 00:04:41,848
there is no group of experts
standing by to prevent this disaster.

73
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:44,851
So we have to create a new team.

74
00:04:44,893 --> 00:04:47,771
I believe we should create
what I call the GERM team.

75
00:04:48,146 --> 00:04:53,777
Germ stands for Global Epidemic
Response and Mobilization.

76
00:04:54,278 --> 00:04:56,488
This group is full-time.

77
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:59,866
Their only priority
is pandemic prevention.

78
00:05:00,409 --> 00:05:02,911
It's made up of a diverse
set of specialists

79
00:05:02,911 --> 00:05:06,123
with a lot of different
realms of expertise:

80
00:05:06,164 --> 00:05:09,626
epidemiologists, data scientists,

81
00:05:09,668 --> 00:05:11,336
logistics experts.

82
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:13,839
And it's not just scientific
and medical knowledge.

83
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:17,926
They also have to have communication
and diplomacy skills.

84
00:05:18,468 --> 00:05:20,262
The cost of this team is significant.

85
00:05:20,304 --> 00:05:21,972
It's over a billion a year

86
00:05:22,014 --> 00:05:26,184
to support the 3,000 people
who would be on this team.

87
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:32,566
And its mission is to stop outbreaks
before they become pandemics.

88
00:05:32,607 --> 00:05:35,777
The work would be coordinated by the WHO.

89
00:05:36,194 --> 00:05:39,323
They'd be present in many
locations around the world,

90
00:05:39,364 --> 00:05:42,367
stationed in public health agencies.

91
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:45,287
They'd work closely
with the national teams,

92
00:05:45,287 --> 00:05:47,289
depending on the income level.

93
00:05:47,789 --> 00:05:50,417
They'd have more
in the lower-income countries.

94
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:53,462
You know, for example,
we could have GERM members

95
00:05:53,754 --> 00:06:00,302
say an epidemiologist, working
out of the Africa CDC office in Abuja.

96
00:06:00,344 --> 00:06:05,140
And a very important thing
is that like firefighters,

97
00:06:05,182 --> 00:06:08,810
a GERM team would do drills.

98
00:06:08,852 --> 00:06:10,729
When you want to have quick response,

99
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:13,648
when you want to make sure
you have all the pieces there

100
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,402
and you can move very quickly,
practice is key.

101
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:20,614
That's how you make sure
everyone knows what to do.

102
00:06:21,239 --> 00:06:25,077
Now, this team, there could be periods
where there's no risky outbreak

103
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:28,038
and they can keep their skills strong

104
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:31,541
by working on some
of the other infectious diseases,

105
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:34,044
but that would be a second priority.

106
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:38,006
They would work with countries
to strengthen their health systems.

107
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:43,845
The health systems are the front line.

108
00:06:44,346 --> 00:06:46,890
You need to know if, say,

109
00:06:46,932 --> 00:06:50,560
a lot of people show up
with a new kind of cough,

110
00:06:51,269 --> 00:06:55,565
that’s when GERM needs to look into it
and say, is this an outbreak?

111
00:06:55,607 --> 00:06:57,109
Is there a new pathogen here?

112
00:06:57,109 --> 00:06:59,111
What is the sequence of that?

113
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:03,615
And so for all of this,
the first 100 days are key.

114
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:06,410
Viruses spread exponentially.

115
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:11,957
And so if you get in there
when the infection rate is fairly small,

116
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:14,459
you can actually stop the spread.

117
00:07:14,876 --> 00:07:17,170
You know, in this epidemic,

118
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,424
if we'd been able to stop it
within 100 days,

119
00:07:20,465 --> 00:07:24,094
we would have saved
over 98 percent of the lives.

120
00:07:24,594 --> 00:07:26,972
Now, we did have countries
that did a good job.

121
00:07:26,972 --> 00:07:28,682
Australia is an example.

122
00:07:28,723 --> 00:07:31,893
They orchestrated diagnostic capacity.

123
00:07:31,935 --> 00:07:36,273
They came up with distancing policies
and quarantine policies.

124
00:07:36,314 --> 00:07:40,735
And so their overall death rate
per capita will be well less

125
00:07:40,777 --> 00:07:42,863
than a 10th of other countries.

126
00:07:43,155 --> 00:07:46,908
But we did not, as a world, contain it.

127
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,703
And that's what we have to do next time.

128
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,998
When COVID struck,
we were almost like Rome

129
00:07:52,998 --> 00:07:56,501
before they had
fire buckets and firefighters.

130
00:07:57,085 --> 00:08:00,589
We didn't have the people,
the systems or the tools we need.

131
00:08:00,589 --> 00:08:02,132
Now, with the right investments,

132
00:08:02,174 --> 00:08:05,760
we can have a whole new
generation of tools,

133
00:08:05,802 --> 00:08:09,181
better diagnostics,
therapeutics and vaccines.

134
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:13,894
A good example in the diagnostic area
is this little machine,

135
00:08:13,935 --> 00:08:15,395
this is called the Lumira.

136
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:20,275
We can have these all over the world
that can test for any number of diseases.

137
00:08:20,317 --> 00:08:22,569
It’s a 10th as expensive as PCR,

138
00:08:22,611 --> 00:08:24,779
it’s absolutely as accurate,
and it’s simple.

139
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:26,865
So it can be used anywhere.

140
00:08:26,865 --> 00:08:28,783
We need other R&D investments.

141
00:08:28,825 --> 00:08:31,828
One that I'm very excited
about is the idea of a drug

142
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:35,832
that you inhale that blocks you
from getting infected.

143
00:08:35,874 --> 00:08:39,377
It can be pathogen-independent
and trigger your immune system

144
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,254
so that you'll be protected.

145
00:08:41,796 --> 00:08:44,341
A lot of the tools, the diagnostic tools

146
00:08:44,382 --> 00:08:47,928
and those infection-blocking
tools are important

147
00:08:47,969 --> 00:08:50,472
because they can be staged in advance.

148
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:52,641
Now, we also need vaccines,

149
00:08:52,682 --> 00:08:56,019
but we want to stop the outbreak

150
00:08:56,061 --> 00:08:59,397
before we have to do
a global vaccination campaign.

151
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:04,027
And so vaccines can play
a couple of different roles,

152
00:09:04,069 --> 00:09:05,403
but not the primary role.

153
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:07,906
We have to invest in more than just that.

154
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:12,452
When we look at vaccines,
they were the miracle of this epidemic.

155
00:09:12,494 --> 00:09:16,706
They saved millions of lives,
but they can be far better.

156
00:09:17,165 --> 00:09:20,252
We need to invent
easier-to-deliver vaccines

157
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,879
that are just a patch you put on your arm

158
00:09:22,921 --> 00:09:24,756
or something that you inhale.

159
00:09:24,756 --> 00:09:27,425
We need vaccines that actually
block infections.

160
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:30,679
In this case, there were lots
of breakthrough infections.

161
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,139
We need vaccines that are broad spectrum,

162
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:35,684
so they work against most
of the emerging variants,

163
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:38,311
which we did not have this time.

164
00:09:38,395 --> 00:09:41,606
And we also need factories
that are standing by

165
00:09:41,606 --> 00:09:44,192
so we can build enough vaccines
for the entire world

166
00:09:44,359 --> 00:09:45,652
within six months

167
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:47,612
and achieve far better equity.

168
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:53,243
The vaccines can also do something
that would be super helpful,

169
00:09:53,243 --> 00:09:56,997
which is to help us eradicate
entire families of viruses.

170
00:09:57,414 --> 00:10:03,003
Innovative new vaccines used properly
could get rid of the flu family,

171
00:10:03,044 --> 00:10:04,337
the coronavirus family.

172
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:06,089
And there's a huge burden of those,

173
00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:07,799
even in non-pandemic years,

174
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:11,261
and if we get rid of it,
it can never cause a pandemic.

175
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:14,848
So I'm talking about investments
in three broad areas:

176
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:16,600
Disease monitoring,

177
00:10:16,641 --> 00:10:18,018
that's GERM.

178
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:21,354
The R and D tools that are far better.

179
00:10:21,396 --> 00:10:25,525
And finally, and the most expensive,
is improved health systems.

180
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:29,112
This won't be cheap, but it'll save lives.

181
00:10:29,154 --> 00:10:31,823
And even it'll save money in the long run.

182
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:34,659
It's like an insurance policy.

183
00:10:35,577 --> 00:10:39,956
The cost to prevent the next pandemic
will be tens of billions of dollars.

184
00:10:40,332 --> 00:10:43,335
But let's compare that
to what we just went through.

185
00:10:43,918 --> 00:10:49,924
The IMF estimates that COVID
has cost nearly 14 trillion dollars.

186
00:10:49,966 --> 00:10:55,847
And so we need to spend billions
in order to save trillions.

187
00:10:56,681 --> 00:10:58,683
And here's the best part of this.

188
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:03,897
Even when we're not having an outbreak,
these investments like the Lumira,

189
00:11:03,938 --> 00:11:05,815
those new vaccines,

190
00:11:05,815 --> 00:11:08,026
they will make people healthier.

191
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,196
They'll shrink the gap,
the health equity gap,

192
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:15,116
which is gigantic,
between rich and poor countries.

193
00:11:15,617 --> 00:11:21,748
For example, we can detect more HIV cases
and do a better job of treatment.

194
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:24,542
We can reduce deaths from malaria.

195
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:28,129
We can get more people high-quality care.

196
00:11:28,171 --> 00:11:30,548
And so this is not just a downer

197
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:33,885
about how to stop things
from getting worse,

198
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:36,763
but also a chance to make things better.

199
00:11:37,972 --> 00:11:40,975
If we take the right steps,

200
00:11:40,975 --> 00:11:45,397
we can make COVID-19 the last pandemic,

201
00:11:45,397 --> 00:11:50,151
and we can build a healthier,
more equitable world for everyone.

202
00:11:50,735 --> 00:11:51,903
Thank you.

203
00:11:51,903 --> 00:11:58,576
(Applause)

204
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,127
Helen Walters: Thank you so much.

205
00:12:07,752 --> 00:12:09,421
I have a few follow-up questions

206
00:12:09,421 --> 00:12:12,382
and one is really
about the formal status of GERM.

207
00:12:12,424 --> 00:12:14,926
So you mentioned this would
cost a billion dollars,

208
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:16,845
you mentioned it comes through the WHO,

209
00:12:16,845 --> 00:12:19,264
but exactly who's running this,
how does this work,

210
00:12:19,264 --> 00:12:20,598
how do we make this happen?

211
00:12:21,391 --> 00:12:23,685
BG: Well, GERM does not exist.

212
00:12:23,685 --> 00:12:28,148
It's a proposal I'm putting forward
that hopefully over the next year,

213
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:32,318
while the pain of the pandemic
is still clear in people's minds,

214
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,862
will get a global consensus.

215
00:12:33,903 --> 00:12:36,114
The rich-world governments
will have to step up

216
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:40,326
like they do with all the aid things
and come up with that money.

217
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:44,080
The way the personnel systems works,
so that it's under WHO,

218
00:12:44,122 --> 00:12:45,957
but a really top-notch team,

219
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:48,626
there will be a lot of debate
about how to do that well.

220
00:12:48,626 --> 00:12:50,420
So, you know, I'm putting it forward

221
00:12:50,462 --> 00:12:54,841
and hopefully within the next year
we'll get that consensus.

222
00:12:54,883 --> 00:12:56,885
HW: Who do you need to pick that up next?

223
00:12:56,926 --> 00:12:59,596
BG: Well, it's really
the rich-world governments.

224
00:12:59,637 --> 00:13:04,434
The WHO has this big yearly meeting,
the World Health Assembly,

225
00:13:04,476 --> 00:13:07,103
and at some point somebody
will put forward a resolution

226
00:13:07,145 --> 00:13:12,942
and we'll see if the extra resources
can be put in for that.

227
00:13:12,942 --> 00:13:15,612
After World War II, we did a lot.

228
00:13:15,653 --> 00:13:19,324
You know, we created the United Nations,
we talked a lot about war.

229
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,785
So I'd be stunned, although, you know,

230
00:13:21,826 --> 00:13:25,163
so far the action has been less
than I would have expected,

231
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:29,042
I'd be stunned if we don't go forward
with something pretty close

232
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,628
to what I'm laying out there.

233
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:34,631
HW: This has been pretty personal for you.

234
00:13:34,672 --> 00:13:37,801
You know, the anti-vaxxers
are out there, they are loud,

235
00:13:37,842 --> 00:13:39,260
and this has become personal.

236
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:42,180
I just wanted to ask, like,
how are you managing that?

237
00:13:42,806 --> 00:13:44,307
BG: Well, it's kind of weird.

238
00:13:45,016 --> 00:13:47,685
(Laughter)

239
00:13:47,685 --> 00:13:52,148
(Applause)

240
00:13:52,816 --> 00:13:56,236
Now, our foundation, the Gates Foundation,
is very involved in vaccines,

241
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:58,571
the invention of new vaccines,
funding vaccines.

242
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:02,867
And we're very proud that through
joint efforts like GAVI,

243
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:04,702
that saved tens of millions of lives.

244
00:14:04,744 --> 00:14:08,289
So it's somewhat ironic to have somebody
turn around and say, no, you know,

245
00:14:08,331 --> 00:14:11,876
we're using vaccines to kill people
or to make money or, you know,

246
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:13,086
we started the pandemic,

247
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:17,006
even some strange things like,
that I somehow want to track, you know,

248
00:14:17,048 --> 00:14:19,008
the location of individuals

249
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:22,637
because I'm so deeply desirous
to know where everybody is.

250
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:24,389
(Laughter)

251
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,225
I'm not sure what I'm going to do
with that information.

252
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:29,727
(Laughter)

253
00:14:30,144 --> 00:14:33,064
You know, does this turn into
something where, you know,

254
00:14:33,064 --> 00:14:35,191
there's constantly
crazy people showing up?

255
00:14:35,233 --> 00:14:36,359
Who knows?

256
00:14:36,985 --> 00:14:39,904
But, you know, hopefully,
as the pandemic calms down,

257
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:41,823
people are more rational about, hey,

258
00:14:41,865 --> 00:14:45,159
vaccines are a miracle
and there's a lot more we can do.

259
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:48,037
HW: So the future is
in our hands in the present.

260
00:14:48,538 --> 00:14:50,665
Bill Gates, thank you
so much for being here.

261
00:14:50,665 --> 00:14:51,833
BG: Thank you.

262
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:55,420
(Applause)
